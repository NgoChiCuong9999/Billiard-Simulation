# Billiard-Simulation
Billiard Simulation is a Java-based game that simulates realistic billiard ball motion and collisions. Players can select maps, add or remove up to 200 balls, and start a dynamic simulation where balls bounce, slow down, and stop naturally. The first ball falling into a hole is instantly announced.
