🎮 Game Introduction – Billiard Simulation

Billiard Simulation is an interactive and educational Java-based game that visually demonstrates the physics of motion, collision, and friction through colorful billiard balls on a virtual table. The project simulates how multiple balls move, bounce off the walls, collide with one another, and eventually slow down until they stop. Each ball is assigned a unique number for identification, allowing players to easily follow individual movements and interactions throughout the simulation.

Players can customize their experience by selecting one of three available maps, each offering a different hole layout and challenge. The game also allows adding or removing up to two hundred balls, making it ideal for both light testing and complex motion analysis. Once the simulation begins, balls are set in motion with randomized velocities and directions, creating a lively and unpredictable environment. As time progresses, air resistance and surface friction gradually reduce the speed of the balls until they come to rest after approximately one minute.

A key feature of this simulation is the detection of the first ball that falls into a hole. When this occurs, a clear notification is displayed to inform the player which ball achieved it. After the simulation ends, players can return to the main menu, select a different map, adjust the number of balls, and start a new session. This combination of interactivity, physics-based movement, and customization makes Billiard Simulation both entertaining and informative for learners and game enthusiasts alike.
